# csharp-awesome

This repository has the code for a talk I give at several conferences.

I often include a pattern matching demo, which you can find at (https://github.com/KathleenDollard/sample-patterns).

Both of these repos are setup with before and after versions that are stored in _branches_. I do not merge the completed branch at the end of the talk because having both available is important to understanding the changes. The starting version is my take on common older code and is approximately what you would write with C# 7.3. The ending version is intended as the best approach for the released version of C# on the date of the conference. A great way to review the talk is to download the repo and update it yourself from the old to new. 

I will update main to the initial starting point for the most recent conference. I'll include the finished code from the conference, sometimes with additional changes that I didn't get to in the talk. I anticipate that this will soon have more examples than I give in any single talk. 

My passion for this is seeing C# become more expressive every year and wanting you and your team to benefit at the pace that makes sense. That pace is very team specific and I want to make it easy for you and your team to uptake new features in the fastest manner your team can accomodate.

Thanks so much for your interest!
